## Wine Quality Classification

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting wine quality using various chemical properties of wine. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and hyperparameter tuning.

## Project Overview

This project aims to classify wine quality based on chemical properties. The dataset used in this project contains features such as alcohol content, malic acid, ash, and others. The following steps were taken to achieve the goal:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Loaded the dataset and performed necessary preprocessing, including splitting the data into training and testing sets and scaling the features using StandardScaler.
  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized the distribution of features before and after scaling to understand the data better.
  
3. **Model Training**: Trained a Logistic Regression model to predict wine quality based on the preprocessed data.
  
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Used GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters for the model, and evaluated the model's performance.
